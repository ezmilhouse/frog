# WORKING WITH VAGRANT
  Before you start working, `reload` the Vagrant box you're working on, otherwise you might run into weird behaviour, especially when it comes to `nodemon` restarting your app hundreds of times for every change. Reload and everything works fine.

  $ v reload app

  If you are on a fresh box, you can `start` all relevant docker containers:

  $ e start

  If it's a used machine, you have to restart all docker containers:

  $ e restart
